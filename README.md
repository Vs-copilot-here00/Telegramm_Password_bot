  Hi!
This is my first Telegram bot, and also the first project that even slightly resembles something.
It's not very useful, if only because of the many other options for recording passwords, this is just a learning project,
but I will be glad if someone actually finds it useful in any field.

  How to connect it:
-> First find @BotFather and get a token for a new bot from him, or use an existing one
-> Then insert the token into the const.py file into the value of the "TOKEN" variable
-> Just run the bot

Thank you, reader!

Important! This is not the whole bot, only a couple of functions are available there, it will be completed by me as soon as possible
